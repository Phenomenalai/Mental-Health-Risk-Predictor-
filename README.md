This project performs exploratory data analysis on a publicly available student mental health survey dataset from Bangladesh. The dataset contains standardized mental health metrics including the **PHQ-9 (depression)**, **BDI-II**, and the **UCLA Loneliness Scale**, along with demographic and contextual variables like academic stress and sleep quality.
